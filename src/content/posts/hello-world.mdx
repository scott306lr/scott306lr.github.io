Welcome! This site is built with Astro and supports **Markdown** out of the box.

## What to expect

- Posts live in `src/content/posts/`
- You can write normal Markdown, or use MDX when you want to embed components.

## MDX works too

MDX is useful for small interactive demos (Astro islands) without turning the whole page into a SPA.
