Welcome! This site is built with Astro and supports **Markdown** (and MDX) out of the box.

## What to expect

- Posts live in `src/content/posts/` (MDX supported).
- Projects live in `src/content/projects/`.
- Most pages ship zero JS unless an island is used.

## MDX works too

MDX is useful for small interactive demos (Astro islands) without turning the whole page into a SPA.

If you want to add your own post, see **How to add content**.
