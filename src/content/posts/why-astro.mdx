Astro is a great fit for content-heavy sites because it ships less JavaScript by default.

## The short version

- Static-first: most pages render to HTML at build time.
- Islands architecture: add interactivity only where needed.
- Great performance defaults: fast pages without fighting the framework.

On this site, I use islands for small widgets and keep the rest server-rendered.
