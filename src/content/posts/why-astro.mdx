Astro is a great fit for content-heavy sites because it ships less JavaScript by default.

## The short version

- Static-first: most pages render to HTML at build time.
- Islands architecture: add interactivity only where it matters.
- Performance-friendly defaults: a fast baseline without constant tuning.

On this site, I use islands for small widgets and keep the rest static/server-rendered.

## A simple rule of thumb

If it doesnt need interactivity, it stays pure HTML/CSS.
