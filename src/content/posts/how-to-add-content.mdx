This post is a quick, practical checklist for adding new content.

## 1) Add a new post / project

### Posts

- Folder: `src/content/posts/`
- Create: `my-post-slug.mdx`
- Best way (uses the template):

```bash
npm run new:post -- my-post-slug 2026-01-11
```

### Projects

- Folder: `src/content/projects/`
- Create: `my-project-slug.mdx`
- Best way:

```bash
npm run new:project -- my-project-slug 2026-01-11
```

## 2) Add and store images

You have two good options.

### Option A (simple): put images in `public/`

- Put images somewhere like: `public/images/my-post/diagram.png`
- Reference it from MDX with a normal `<img>` (fast and easy):

```mdx
<img src="https://placehold.co/800x450.png" alt="Diagram" />
```

Example (rendered below):

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x450.png" alt="Diagram" />

This works because everything in `public/` is served from the site root.

### Option B (optimized): import from `src/assets/`

If you want Astro image optimization (`<Image />`), store images in `src/assets/` and import them.
Example:

```mdx
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import figure from '../../assets/profile-placeholder.png';
---

<Image src={figure} alt="Example image" width={800} format="webp" />
```

Notes:
- The relative import path depends on where the MDX file lives.
- Use this when you care about responsive images/optimization.

## 3) Code blocks

Use fenced code blocks:

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

For inline code, use backticks: `npm run build`.

## 4) When you are ready to publish

- Set `draft: false`
- Verify locally:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
```
